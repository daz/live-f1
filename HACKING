Maintainer tools
----------------

The source tree for live-f1 uses the GNU Build System (sometimes known
as the GNU Autotools).  You will need the following versions
installed.

	* GNU Autoconf 2.59
	* GNU Automake 1.9
	* GNU Gettext 0.14.5

After checking our live-f1 from Bazaar-NG you will need to use these
tools to generate the build files.  The correct way to do this is to
simply run ‘autoreconf -i’ from the top-level source directory.


Configure options
-----------------

There are some configure script options that you may find useful when
hacking on live-f1.

	* --enable-compiler-warnings: (GCC only) adds extra CFLAGS to
	increase the source checking and treat all warnings as errors.

	* --disable-compiler-optimisations: ensures that no compiler
	optimisations are performed during compilation, easing
	debugging.

	* --disable-linker-optimisations: disables the usual linker
	optimisations, slightly decreasing build time.

	* --enable-compiler-coverage: (GCC only) enables coverage file
	generation, useful for test suites.


Coding style
------------

The coding style for live-f1 is roughly K&R with function names in
column 0, and variable names aligned in declarations.

The right results can be almost acheived by doing the following.

	* GNU Emacs: if you're not using auto-newline, the following
	should do the right thing:

	(defun live-f1-c-mode-common-hook ()
	  (c-set-style "k&r")
	  (setq indent-tabs-mode t
	        c-basic-offset 8))

	* VIM: the default works except for the case labels in switch
	statements.  Set the following option to fix that:

	setlocal cinoptions=:0

	* Indent: can be used to reformat code in a different style:

	indent -kr -i8 -psl
